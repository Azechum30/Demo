# Demonstration on Git

This tutorial is focused on the fundamentals of git and github

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open source version control system. A version control system allows 
developers the freedom and ability to manage changes in their documents, large websites, or
any software. The version control provides an interface for developers to keep track of changes
that are made in their project repositories. In modern day application or software development
particularly in an agile software system, developers work in teams and most of those developers
do not live in the geo-location. With the help of git as a version control system, these developers
that are working in teams are able keep track of the contributions of each developer via github repository.
