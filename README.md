# Demonstration on Git

This tutorial is focused on the fundamentals of git and github

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open source version control system. A version control system allows 
developers the freedom and ability to manage changes in their documents, large websites, or
any software. A version control provides an interface for developers to keep track of changes
that are made in their project repositories. In modern day application or software development
particularly in an agile software development environment, developers work in teams and most of those developers
do not live in the same geo-location. With the help of git as a version control system, these developers
that are working in teams are able keep track of the contributions of each developer via a github or gitlab or 
any remote repository.


## What then is the difference between Git and Github?

The difference between git and github is that git is a version control system whilst github
is a website that stores your git repositories or projects. 

## Terminologies in Git

a. Command line interface (CLI). A command line or also known as the terminal in most operating systems
in computers refers to an interactive interface or platform that allows you to perform or issue commands
to the computer hardware by writing out your commands instead of clicking on graphical icons. A command
line or terminal interface is a very important tool for very software developer to get along with. It is very 
faster than using a GUI. There are several command line interfaces depending on the OS that you choose to 
run on your computer. Examples include the Windows command line which come with the windows operating system,
the windows powershell which also come with the windows operating system. Other command line tools that can 
be downloaded as third-party proprietary software tools and installed on the windows pc include;
Git bash shell, Zshell, Azure CLI and many others.
